# About me

This page summarizes the interests and philosophies that I apply to writing and my work in general.

* Inclusive writing

## üß† My approach to knowledge management
When I approach a problem related to knowledge management, I like to look at it from a few points of view:
* **Information architecture**
* **Content strategy**
* **Processes**

### Information architecture
The discipline of **information architecture (IA)** aims to answer questions like *"How can we guide the user to the information they're looking for?"* and *"How can we minimize the mental effort required to find that information?"*

Information architecture is itself a multi-faceted domain. Among the topics it encompasses are:
* Organizational structures and schemas
* Controlled vocabularies, e.g. tagging systems
* Navigation and labeling
* Search systems

I've implemented systems like the ones above in complex organizations with thousands of employees. Such scenarios often require a combination of IA tactics, such as marrying top-down, hierarchical schemas with bottom-up, database-like schemas.

When in doubt, I consult my IA reference of choice: [*Information Architecture, 4th Edition*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/) AKA the "polar bear book" from O'Reilly.

### Content strategy
How can we best serve the user through the content of our knowledge resources? What standards and style guidelines do we use?

* Style guides ‚Äî Microsoft style guide
* I've written a lot of style guides

### Processes
Approaching knowledge management from a process-oriented perspective leads one to pose questions like "When does knowledge need to be created, updated, or deprecated?" and "What's the knowledge 'lifecycle'"?
