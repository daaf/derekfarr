# 👋  Hi, I'm Derek!

![Me](/images/me.jpeg)

## 💁‍♂️ Who am I?
I'm a technical communication professional living in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Outside of work, I'm interested in the intersection of art and technology. I also like photography, playing guitar, piano, and drums, and getting lost on my bike!

For more about me, visit the [About me](https://derekfarr.com/docs/about/about-me) page.


## 👨‍💻 What's up with this website?
This website is a repository of information both for me and about me.


Under _Articles_ are instructional pages I've written primarily to make my own life easier. I've published them here in the hopes they make someone else's life easier too. Under _About_ are pages about me, my work, and this website.

For more information on the site itself, check out the [About this site](https://derekfarr.com/docs/about/about-this-site) page.
