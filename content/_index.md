# 👋  Hi, I'm Derek!

{{< columns >}}
## 💁‍♂️ Who am I?
I'm a business operations professional living in Philadelphia, USA. I like to spend my free time exploring programming and other technical topics. I also like photography, playing guitar and drums, and getting lost on my bike!

## 👨‍💻 What's up with this website?
This website is a repository of information both for me and about me.

Under _Articles_ are instructional pages I've written primarily to make my own life easier. I've published them here in the hopes they make someone else's life easier too. Under _About_ are pages about me, my work, and this website.

For more information on the site itself, check out the [About this site](https://derekfarr.com/docs/about/about-this-site) page.
