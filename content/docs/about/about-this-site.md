# About this site

This site is a basic exemplar of the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.wtf/). It uses a [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) toolset and workflow.

Specifically, the site is built with:[](https://gohugo.io)

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator
* [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) as a theme for Hugo
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com) to host the source code repository
* [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) as a "headless" CMS[](https://www.github.com)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for hosting and CI/CD

[Vale](https://vale.sh) helps me manage the content quality of the site. I supplement Vale's out-of-the-box prose linting with the [alex](https://vale.sh/hub/alex/) and [Microsoft](https://vale.sh/hub/microsoft/) packages to keep my writing inclusive and in aligned with the standards of the Microsoft Manual of Style.
