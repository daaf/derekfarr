# Access resources on a remote server with Wireguard

## Introduction
I self-host a few apps on my home network, using a small single-board computer as my server.

Until recently, I was only able to access my self-hosted apps at home, on my home network. That limitation was inconvenient, to say the least.

For example, one of the apps I self-host is Actual, an open-source budgeting app that totally changed the way I manage my personal finances. I love Actual, and I love the idea of keeping my financial data safe on my home network away from prying eyes. However, the inability to access Actual remotely meant I couldn't update my budget or add transaction data without being at home. Annoying!

My solution? Use Wireguard to create a secure VPN tunnel to my home server, allowing me to access my self-hosted apps remotely, whether I'm across the street or across the world.
