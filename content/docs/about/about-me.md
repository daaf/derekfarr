# About me

This page summarizes the interests and philosophies that I apply to writing and my work in general.



## üìù My approach to writing

* Writing for the web
* Inclusive writing

## üß† My approach to knowledge management
When I approach a problem related to knowledge management (KM), I like to examine it from 4 points of view:
* [**Information architecture**](#information-architecture)
* [**Content strategy**](#content-strategy)
* [**Processes**](#processes)
* [**Enablement**](#enablement)

The items above are a simple heuristic that helps me parse and decompose KM issues that might otherwise appear confoundingly ambiguous. Each is discussed in more detail below.

### Information architecture
**Information architecture (IA)** is a discipline focused on finding the best ways to guide users to the assets they need. It's a multi-faceted domain that bears many similarities to user experience (UX) design.

Among the topics encompassed by IA are:
* Organizational structures and schemas
* Controlled vocabularies, e.g. tagging systems
* Navigation and labeling
* Search systems

I apply the concepts of IA to my work on documentation knowledge bases (KBs) and corporate intranets, whether I'm building something from nothing or tidying up someone else's [mess](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/).

Approaching KM problems from an IA perspective helps me consider:
* How information should be organized
* How to label or title resources in a way that best describes the content
* How to use navigation systems to guide users to information
* How to optimize the content for any applicable search systems
* If a tagging system could improve the findability of information

My IA reference of choice is [*Information Architecture, 4th Edition*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/) AKA the O'Reilly "polar bear book." For a high-level introduction, I recommend [*How to Make Sense of Any Mess*](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/) by Abby Covert, cheekily referenced above.

### Content strategy
**Content strategy** is another multi-faceted discipline with applications in a broad range of industries and contexts. [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/) [defines](https://digital.gov/topics/content-strategy/) it as  "planning, creating, delivering, and governing content that meets the needs of its users and achieves an organization's goals."

In my work, I apply the principles of content strategy when developing standards and style guides for the content of knowledge bases and similar resources.

Approaching KM problems from a content strategy perspective helps me consider how the low-level content of a knowledge resource can best serve the intended user.

**Example:** Adhering to the standards of [writing for the web](#üìù-my-approach-to-writing) can serve knowledge base users by providing them with easily scannable, readable, and digestible content.

### Processes
Approaching knowledge management from a **process** perspective prompts me to pose questions like "When does knowledge need to be created, updated, or deprecated?" and "What's the knowledge 'lifecycle'"? In some ways, it overlaps with content strategy in that it asks _when_ one might need to plan/create/deliver/govern knowledge.

I have experience collaborating with program managers and other leaders to define KM processes for large, distributed organizations. 

### Enablement
I use "**enablement**" as an umbrella term for practices and deliverables that help users adopt the resources, processes, and governance I create.

Considering enablement when designing a knowledge management solution helps me maintain a focus on end users' present needs and abilities. For example, if I develop a tagging system for a corporate intranet, but find that it requires a full two-day workshop for users to understand, I might conclude that the system isn't matching users' present abilities and needs to change.

**Templates** are a key enablement mechanism in any environment where users create information themselves, e.g. a wiki or corporate intranet. By establishing templates and getting users to adopt them, a knowledge manager can "instantiate" certain standards or conventions by default in every piece of user-created content.
