## Who am I?

I'm a technical writer and e-learning developer living in Philadelphia, USA. I like to spend my time both at work and outside of it exploring programming and other technical topics. I also like playing guitar and getting lost on my bike.

## What's up with this website?

This website is a collection of projects and other work by me. At the time of this writing, the site is extremely new, but I hope to add to it over time.
