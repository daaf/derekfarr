# About me

This page summarizes the interests and philosophies that I apply to writing and my work in general.

## üìù My approach to writing

I aim for my writing to be as inclusive and understandable as possible. To that end, I typically adhere to the following principles and practices:
* [Writing for the web](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/writing-for-the-web.html)
* [Plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/)
* Inclusive writing

My style guide of choice is [Microsoft Manual of Style](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide).

## üß† My approach to knowledge management
When I approach a problem related to knowledge management (KM), I like to examine it from 4 points of view. Click the boxes below to learn more about each.

{{< expand "Information architecture">}}
**Information architecture (IA)** is a discipline focused on finding the best ways to guide users to the assets they need. It's a multi-faceted domain that bears many similarities to user experience (UX) design.

Among the topics encompassed by IA are:
* Organizational structures and schemas
* Controlled vocabularies and tagging systems
* Navigation and labeling
* Search systems

I apply the concepts of IA to my work on documentation knowledge bases and corporate intranets, whether I'm building something from nothing or tidying up someone else's [mess](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/).

Approaching KM problems from an IA perspective helps me consider:
* How to organize information
* How to label or title resources in a way that best describes the content
* How to use navigation systems to guide users to information
* How to optimize the content for any applicable search systems
* If a tagging system could improve the findability of information

My IA reference of choice is [*Information Architecture, 4th Edition*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/) also known as the O'Reilly "polar bear book." For a high-level introduction, I recommend [*How to Make Sense of Any Mess*](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/) by Abby Covert, cheekily referenced earlier.

{{< expand "Content strategy">}}
**Content strategy** is another multi-faceted discipline with applications in a broad range of industries and contexts. [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov/) [defines](https://digital.gov/topics/content-strategy/) it as  "planning, creating, delivering, and governing content that meets the needs of its users and achieves an organization's goals."

In my work, I apply the principles of content strategy when developing standards and style guides for the content of knowledge bases and similar resources.

Approaching KM problems from a content strategy perspective helps me consider how the low-level content of a knowledge resource can best serve the intended user.

**Example:** Adhering to the standards of [writing for the web](#üìù-my-approach-to-writing) can serve knowledge base users by providing them with scannable, readable, and digestible content.

{{< expand "Processes">}}
### Processes
Approaching knowledge management from a **process** perspective prompts me to think about when I or a user need to create, update, or deprecate knowledge. In some ways, it overlaps with content strategy in that it asks _when_ one might need to plan/create/deliver/govern knowledge.

I have experience collaborating with program managers and other leaders to define KM processes for large, distributed organizations.

{{< expand "Enablement">}}
### Enablement
I use "**enablement**" as an umbrella term for practices and deliverables that help users adopt the resources, processes, and governance I create.

Considering enablement when designing a knowledge management solution helps me maintain focus on end users' present needs and abilities. For example, if I develop a tagging system for a corporate intranet, but find that it requires a full two-day workshop for users to understand, I might conclude that the system isn't matching users' present abilities and needs to change.

**Templates** are a key enablement mechanism in any environment where users create information themselves, for example a wiki or corporate intranet. By establishing templates and getting users to adopt them, a knowledge manager can "instantiate" certain standards or conventions by default in every piece of user-created content.
